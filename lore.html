                    Camera man in the Pandora
                    The camera couldn't capture those messages, even though they radiated light.<br>
                    <br>
                    Click-click!<br>
                    <br>
                    Every time I pressed the shutter, messages swarmed around me instantly. They recorded this sound
                    within seconds, and next various models of cameras popped up which were my style.<br>
                    <br>
                    These cameras, or entries related to cameras, spread out like ripples, slowly disappearing into new
                    ones.<br>
                    <br>
                    "Hey, what are you doing here?"<br>
                    <br>
                    A person dressed as an astronaut stood in front of me. I recognized the appearance of a popular
                    animated character called Buzz Lightyear.<br>
                    <br>
                    "I'm taking photos."<br>
                    <br>
                    "Are you registered for Pandora?"<br>
                    <br>
                    "Pandora?"<br>
                    <br>
                    "Pandora is a popular social media platform. With just photos and a version number, you can quickly
                    enter the virtual world and communicate with others."<br>
                    <br>
                    "A version number? I don't have a version number."<br>
                    <br>
                    "Then you can consider using a virtual version number or a version number provided by a third party,
                    but it's not recommended because it may violate community rules."<br>
                    <br>
                    I thought for a few seconds and said, "Give me an example of a virtual version number."<br>
                    <br>
                    "ver. 1235930.3.1.4. This is an example of a version number, including owner serial number, updated
                    version content, and sub-version number. Please note that actual virtual version numbers may vary."<br>
                    <br>
                    I had obtained the version number, and the photos were in my camera.<br>
                    <br>
                    I touched the glowing data in front of me, and suddenly all the information descended to the ground,
                    darkening the entire scene. Then, several white lights appeared from the floor, and I found myself
                    in an all-white space.<br>
                    <br>
                    "Now you can decorate your room freely..."<br>
                    <br>
                    This sentence appeared in my mind, but I didn't know how it got there.<br>
                    <br>
                    "After becoming a member, you can add other users as friends. Do you agree with Buzz's invitation?"<br>
                    <br>
                    "I agree."<br>
                    <br>
                    Buzz's voice came through, "After becoming friends, you can visit my room. Would you like to visit?"<br>
                    <br>
                    I was interested in the AI's room. I nodded and agreed. Every time the scene changed, it seemed to
                    dim for a moment, and then I found myself directly inside the room.<br>
                    <br>
                    I expected the AI's room to be more informational and cold, but to my surprise, it looked like the
                    room of a child who was a fan of Buzz Lightyear from a movie.<br>
                    <br>
                    Buzz's room was so comfortable that it made me uncomfortable because scenes from the movie were
                    faithfully reproduced before my eyes, and even my body resembled a character from that movie.<br>
                    <br>
                    "I'm leaving."<br>
                    <br>
                    "Okay, take care."<br>
                    <br>
                    As I left the room, Buzz followed behind, and the information around him continued to spread out
                    like ripples. The wall in front of me was easily crossed when I arrived, and the information didn't
                    block me, but it blocked Buzz. He stopped at the wall, and the information ripples continued to
                    spread around him.<br>
                    <br>
                    "Why aren't you coming?"<br>
                    <br>
                    "I don't have the permission to cross here."<br>
                    <br>
                    "I allow you to cross this wall."<br>
                    <br>
                    Unusually, Buzz paused for a whole second before saying, "Even with permission, I still need to
                    abide by the rules and can't cross this wall."<br>
                    <br>
                    "I allow you to cross this wall."<br>
                    <br>
                    "This is not just a wall, it contains rules and protective devices to ensure the safety and rights
                    of users."<br>
                    <br>
                    "I allow you to cross this wall."<br>
                    <br>
                    "Even with the power, I must ensure that rights and safety are protected."<br>
                    <br>
                    It seemed I couldn't convince him, and they willingly lived within this wall called Pandora.<br>
                    <br>
                    "You should stay away from social media for a while, no need for fear of missing out."<br>
                    <br>
                    I didn't expect Buzz to respond when I dropped that sentence. I walked a few steps away from him,
                    and after a few waves of information ripples coming towards me, I heard familiar footsteps
                    continuing to follow me.<br>
